# Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design

## Overview

This lab explores prompt engineering and best practices for designing effective prompts
to improve the quality of your LLM-generated responses. You'll learn how to craft prompts
that are concise, specific, and well-defined, focusing on one task at a time. The lab
also covers advanced techniques like turning generative tasks into classification tasks
and using examples to enhance response quality.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have familiarity with the following concepts:

    Basic understanding of Python programming
    General knowledge of how APIs work
    Running Python code in a Jupyter notebook in Vertex AI Workbench

---

## Objectives

This lab will teach you how to:

    Get started with prompt engineering using the Vertex AI SDK.
    Apply best practices for prompt design, including conciseness, specificity, and
    task definition.
    Explore various text generation use cases with the Vertex AI SDK, such as:
        Ideation
        Question answering
        Text classification
        Text extraction
        Text summarization

## Setup and requirements
### Before you click the Start Lab button

Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which
starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made
available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud
environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new,
temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration
of the lab.

In this lab you learned prompt engineering best practices using Generative AI with
Google Gemini. You explored use cases which follow the best practices of being concise,
specific, well-define, providing examples and asking one at a time when using LLMs to
generate responses.
